diagnosis of pneumonia	The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans. Meanwhile, lungs are also vulnerable and are easily damaged by inflammation or impact lesions during the course of our daily lives. Due to the epidemic of COVID-19 pneumonia, the confirmed and suspected cases often grow rapidly beyond the capabilities of medical institutions, rapid and accurate diagnosis for patients have become the first priority. Hence, ultrasound images have started to be adopted in lung diagnosis as they are more convenient, flexible, cheaper, and without ionizing radiation as compared with CT and CXR. This paper aims to use VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet networks to accurately classify Lung Ultrasound images of pneumonia according to different clinical stages based on self-made LUS datasets. The hyperparameters of the three networks were tuned and their performances were carefully compared. Our results indicate that the EfficientNet model outperformed the others, providing the best classification accuracies for 3 and 4 clinical stages of pneumonia are 94.62% and 91.18%, respectively. The best classification accuracy of 8 imagological features of pneumonia is 82.75%. This result is a proof of the promising potential of the LUS device to be used in pneumonia diagnosis and prove the viability of deep learning for LUS classification of pneumonia.

Voice prosthesis
Patient -specific design	Advanced computer technology can be used to design and customize a Trachea-Esophageal Puncture (TEP) voice prosthesis for speech restoration. Current voice prostheses have a standard range of sizes and shape that do not cater for all patients. This causes issues such as transprosthetic and periprosthetic leakages due to poor valve closure and misfit of the prosthesis in the patient’s fistula respectively. To address these limitations, we present a Computer Aided Design (CAD) methodology that utilizes patient’s imaging data, simulations and rapid prototyping to develop the world’s first patient-specific carbon nanocomposite voice prosthesis. The outer skin of the device is made from Carbon Nanotube–Polydimethylsiloxane (CNT–PDMS) and is geometrically customizable to fit the patient’s fistula for better seal. CAD and simulation of the prostheses based on patient-specific anatomical dimensions from imaging data are performed and evaluated. The finite element analysis results indicated that patient specificity in design produces lower and more even distribution of stress in the surrounding tissues compared to a modular cylindrical design. Flow simulations and in-vitro experiments to study the air flow resistance of the novel magnetic ball bearing valve and a range of inner diameters showed lower flow resistance compared to other types of prostheses. Finally, successful preliminary in-vivo experiments were carried out on live pig models to verify the feasibility of the patient-specific CAD methodology based on the subjects’ imaging data. The in-vivo results have demonstrated a close fit of the customized device in the fistula with no leakage observed through the prosthesis when water was flushed down the esophagus. The advantages of our patient-specific voice prosthesis methodology over current methods of estimation and relying on fixed prosthesis sizes are the elimination of surgical correction to seal oversized fistulas and unnecessary multiple insertions due to incorrect sizing and misfit. This paper highlights the usefulness of assimilating patient -specific CAD as part of the voice prosthesis fabrication process to produce better healthcare quality and eliminate leakages.			http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448514002024

The introduction of Tablet-based augmented reality (AR) into surgical robots may assist surgeons with overcoming these problems. In this paper, we proposed and developed a robot-assisted surgical system with interactive surgical guidance using tablet-based AR with a Kinect sensor for three-dimensional (3D) localization of patient anatomical structures and intraoperative 3D surgical tool navigation. Depth data acquired from the Kinect sensor was visualized in cone-shaped layers for 3D AR-assisted navigation. Virtual visual cues generated by the tablet were overlaid on the images of the surgical field for spatial reference. We evaluated the proposed system and the experimental results showed that the tablet-based visual guidance system could assist surgeons in locating internal organs, with errors between 1.74 and 2.96 mm. We also demonstrated that the system was able to provide mobile augmented guidance and interaction for surgical tool navigation.			http://www.mdpi.com/2218-6581/6/2/13

Surgical equipment	Remote center of motion (RCM) is an important concept in the kinematics for robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This work focuses on the kinematic modeling of mechanism design for programmable RCM in MIS. Programmable RCM uses multiple joints coordination to maintain the isocenter of surgical tool manipulation during MIS. In this work, the kinematic task requirement is studied using a multibody system analysis approach. A generalized model based on closed-loop kinematic chain was proposed. Next, an appropriate serial manipulator was conceptualized and kinematically modeled. Finally, simulation-based evaluations were performed on virtual models built with modeling software tools. The contribution of this work is the introduction of a model-based design analysis methodical approach. This will provide a framework for the implementation of a model-based control scheme in robotic minimally invasive surgery. In addition, this work could offer potential insights to better innovations for mechanical RCM system. 2010 IEEE.	Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Current technologies are restricted by minimal access of the surgical site, posing various limitations in application. In this paper, we propose a novel magnesium-based bioabsorbable microclip, discuss our design considerations and evaluate the microclip's feasibility as a miniature wound closure device. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate that the microclip fastens securely to the vocal fold, while in vivo studies show bioabsorbability and a lack of adverse side effects, suggesting that the microclips are viable as implantable devices.

surgery	Implantation of a voice prosthesis (VP) is a common surgical procedure for voice restoration in patients after total laryngectomy. Current procedures comprise surgical creation of a fistula by Tracheoesophageal Puncture (TEP) and insertion of a VP after fistula maturity. Leveraging on the advantages of Transnasal Esophagoscopy (TNE), a handheld mechatronic device is designed for subsequent insertion of the VP after TEP to allow for immediate voice restoration to the patient. Experimental results demonstrated the clinical viability of the proposed medical device and method for TEP and immediate prosthesis placement.	12542176

Young Adult	Mechanical and computational models consisting of flow channels with convergent and oscillating constrictions have been applied to study the dynamics of human vocal fold vibration. To the best of our knowledge, no mechanical model has been studied using a material substitute with similar physical properties to the human vocal fold for surgical experimentation. In this study, we design and develop a mechanical larynx with agarose as a vocal fold substitute, and assess its suitability for surgical experimentation. Agarose is selected as a substitute for the vocal fold as it exhibits similar nonlinear hyperelastic characteristics to biological soft tissue. Through uniaxial compression and extension tests, we determined that agarose of 0.375% concentration most closely resembles the vocal fold mucosa and ligament of a 20-year old male for small tensile strain with an R(2) value of 0.9634 and root mean square error of 344.05+/-39.84 Pa. Incisions of 10 mm lengthwise and 3 mm in depth were created parallel to the medial edge on the superior surface of agar phantom. These were subjected to vibrations of 80, 130, and 180 Hz, at constant amplitude of 0.9 mm over a period of 10 min each in the mechanical larynx model. Lateral expansion of the incision was observed to be most significant for the lower frequency of 80 Hz. This model serves as a basis for future assessments of wound closure techniques during microsurgery to the vocal fold.	Choo, J Q
