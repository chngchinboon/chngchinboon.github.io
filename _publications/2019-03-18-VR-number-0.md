excerpt: 'With the mindset of constant improvement in efficiency and safety in the workspace and training in Singapore, there is a need to explore varying technologies and their capabilities to fulfil this need. The ability of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) to create an immersive experience of tying the virtual and physical environments coupled with information filtering capabilities brings a possibility of introducing this technology into the training process and workspace. This paper surveys current research trends, findings and limitation of VR and AR in its effect on human performance, specifically in Singapore, and our experience in the National University of Singapore (NUS).'
